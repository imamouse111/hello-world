# hello-world
Baby's First Repository
I'm new to GitHub. I have no idea what I'm doing yet but I'm learning. I'm a graphic designer (currently unemployed due to COVID-19) so I'm using this time to learn new skills for when the job market improves. Most of my experience is in print media but I have tinkered with web design here and there. Nothing I would consider portfolio worhty though. Hopefully I can get some projects up and running soon and not look like such a noob with just a hello world project.
